Updated Exsiting file so that it follows accessibility standards. Aslo add semantic HTML elements and some logic structure to the HTML file. Updated the CSS file by adding descriptive titles and consolidating some classes.

Note:
The repository does show that I uploaded my index and css files plus the same files are in the developer folder. I should have have removed the files I was working on from the developer folder from the start so I could present my page link but didn't realize this till the end.
